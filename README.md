pyro-github-markdown
====================

Github flavoured markdown field type for PyroCMS. Most of the work for this repo is taken from [GitHub-Flavored Markdown Comments](https://github.com/evansolomon/wp-github-flavored-markdown-comments) plugin for Wordpress. That repository is also based on [Michel Fortin's PHP markdown library](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown/) with added features from [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.com/github/github-flavored-markdown).

*All I did was just bring it all together and make it play nice with Pyro.*

## Usage

* Install the field type as normal.
* Add the field type to a page type or stream
* Enter in your sexy Github Markdown
* Just use `{{ your_field_slug }}` to render the HTML
